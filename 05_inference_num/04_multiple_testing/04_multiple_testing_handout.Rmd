The previous lab in this chapter introduced the Bonferroni correction as a method for controlling Type I error when conducting pairwise $t$-tests following an ANOVA. This lab further more formally introduces the multiple testing problem and one specific approach for controlling Type I error (controlling the **experiment-wise error rate**, the probability of making at least one Type I error). 

The material in this lab is an extension to Section 5.5 of *OpenIntro Biostatistics*.

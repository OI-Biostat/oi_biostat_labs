This lab generalizes inference for binomial proportions to the setting of two-way contingency tables. Hypothesis testing in a two-way table assesses whether the two variables of interest are associated; this approach can be applied to settings with two or more groups and for responses that have two or more categories. Measures of association in two-by-two tables are also discussed.

The material in this lab corresponds to Sections 8.3 and 8.5 in *OpenIntro Biostatistics*.

### Introduction

*The $\chi^2$ test of independence*

In the $\chi^2$ test of independence, the observed number of cell counts are compared to the number of **expected** cell counts, where the expected counts are calculated under the null hypothesis.

  - $H_0$: the row and column variables are not associated

  - $H_A$: the row and column variables are associated

The expected count for the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column is
\[E_{i, j} = \dfrac{(\text{row $i$ total}) \times (\text{column $j$ total}) }{n}, \]
where $n$ is the total number of observations.

The **$\chi^2$ test statistic** is calculated as
\[\chi^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^r \sum_{j = 1}^c \dfrac{(E_{i, j} - O_{i, j})^2}{E_{i, j}}, \]
and is approximately distributed $\chi^2$ with degrees of freedom $(r - 1)(c - 1)$, where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns. $O_{i, j}$ represents the observed count in row $i$, column $j$.

For each cell in a table, the **residual** equals
\[\dfrac{O_{i, j} - E_{i, j}}{\sqrt{E_{i,j}}}. \]
Residuals with a large magnitude contribute the most to the $\chi^2$ statistic. If a residual is positive, the observed value is greater than the expected value; if a residual is negative, the observed value is less than the expected.

*Measures of association in two-by-two tables*

Unit 1 introduced the **relative risk (RR)**, a measure of the risk of a certain event occurring in one group relative to the risk of the event occurring in another group, as a numerical summary for two-by-two ($2 \times 2$) table. The relative risk can also be thought of as a measure of association for $2 \times 2$ tables.

Consider the following hypothetical two-by-two table. The relative risk of Outcome A can be calculated by using either Group 1 or Group 2 as the reference group:

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{r|rrr}
		\hline
		& Outcome A & Outcome B & Sum\\ 
		\hline
		Group 1 & $a$ & $b$ & $a + b$ \\ 
		Group 2 & $c$ & $d$ & $c + d$ \\
		Sum & $a + c$ & $b + d$ & $a + b + c + d = n$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}	
	\caption{A hypothetical two-by-two table of outcome by group.}
\end{table}


\[RR_{\text{A, comparing Group 1 to Group 2}} = \dfrac{a/(a + b)}{c/(c+d)} \]
\[RR_{\text{A, comparing Group 2 to Group 1}} = \dfrac{c/(c + d)}{a/(a+b)} \]

The relative risk should only be calculated for tables where the proportions $a/(a + b)$ and $c/(c + d)$ represent the incidence of Outcome A within the populations from which Groups 1 and 2 are sampled.

The **odds ratio (OR)** is a measure of association that remains valid even when it is not possible to estimate incidence of an outcome from the sample data. The **odds** of Outcome A in Group 1 are $a/b$, while the odds of Outcome A in Group 2 are $c/d$.

\[OR_{\text{A, comparing Group 1 to Group 2}} = \dfrac{a/b}{c/d} = \dfrac{ad}{bc} \]
\[OR_{\text{A, comparing Group 2 to Group 1}} = \dfrac{c/d}{a/b} = \dfrac{bc}{ad} \]
